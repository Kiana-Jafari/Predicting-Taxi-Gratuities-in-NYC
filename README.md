For this project, after running A/B tests, hypothesis tests, and EDA, the Automatidata team is ready to create a machine learning model for TLC; I was asked for building multiple machine learning models using tree-based modeling techniques to predict on a binary target class (that indicates whether the customer is expected to tip â‰¥ 20%.), and aggregate them, to find which of them performs better. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.

**The purpose** of this model was to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.

**The goal** of this model was to predict whether a customer is a generous tipper.

The data team used two different modeling architectures and compared their results. Both models performed acceptably, with a random forest architecture yielding slightly better predictions. As a result, the team would recommend beta testing with taxi drivers to gain further feedback.
